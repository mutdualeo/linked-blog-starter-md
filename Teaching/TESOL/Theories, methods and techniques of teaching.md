- Approach, method, technique: Approach is set of principle that method get used of. In order to execute the method, techniques is applied
- Questions:
	- Where did it come from?
	- what does it involve?
	- what is positive about it?
	- What is negative about it?
- Methods:
	- The classical method (grammar translation)
		- How: taking N.Lang to F.Lang vise versa
		- Pros: 
			- Most popular method
			- Able to inference with similar grammar
		- Cons: 
			- Does not develop speaking
			- Unnatural 
	- Direct method (natural method)
		- How: try to recreate natural environment to learn English
			- Audio lingualism (army method)
				- behaviorism Pavilov Stimulus -> Response
				- Listen - repeat (drills)
		- Pros: 
			- Quickly learn vocabulary
			- Pronunciation
		- Cons: 
			- Realistic context
			- Errors not a faults in the learning process
	- The silent way - Caleb Gattegno
		- How: constructivist.
			- use colored rods to represent a sound in phonemes -> teach vocab and grammar by choosing suitable color and length of the rods
		- Pros: 
			- Used cognition in the learning process (brain is physically involve)
			- Fun
		- Cons:
			- Need learning before applying (both T and S)
			- Distant from teacher
	- Suggesterpedia
		- Affective filter: this method try to lower this by mimicry the womb
			- Internal: Previous experience (failure in the past -> inhibit future)
			- External: surrounding while we study (maybe it's too noisy)
		- How: reduce affective filter by using internal and external
			- Music
				- 1st concert lively music (active)
					- active part of lesson -> start brainwave -> put into receptive mood
				- 2nd concert baroque music (passive)
					- dictation process
					- "sponge"
		- Pros:
			- very comfortable
			- clear psychological theory
		- Cons:
			- Too different
			- Not easy to create the condition
	- Total physical response
		- how: introduce movement into the learning
		- Pros: 
			- good for young learners
			- long term retention
		- Cons:
			- not good for high level and 1-1 professional 
			- long silent period

- methodology
	- ESA 
		- Straight arrow ESA lesson: E -> S -> A
			- How?
				- E - engaging phase 
					- Purpose
						- To get the students talking and thinking in English
					- Typical activities
						- Fizz Buzz
						- Listing alphabet game
				- S - study phase - (1)boardwork - (2) activities
					- Purpose: cover teaching, check understanding
						- boardwork: elicit the teaching point from the students. Cover any gaps in knowledge
						- Ask targeted specific questions about the teaching point
					- Typical activities: 
						- gap fill activities
						- matching activities
						- word order
				- A - activate phase - put the learning in a realistic context 
					- Purpose: put the material into a realistic context. Actual language use
					- Typical activities
						- Roleplay
						- Surveys (mill drill)
						- debates  
		- Pros
			- Communication
			- works for all particular level
		- Cons
			- become predicable (boring for high lv students)
			- noisy
		- Sample: 
			- engage: Show a video of animals, students say what they like and elicit more animals
			- Study
				- boardwork
					- it can run
					- it can't 
				- worksheet
					- gapfill
					- matching
				- activate
					- create a super animal
		- Boomerang ESA: E -> A -> S -> A2
			- E: discuss about jobs and interviews
			- A: role play
			- S: boardwork - language and grammar; worksheets - check understanding
			- A2: repeat roleplay
		- Patchwork ESA: E -> (       ) -> A
			- E:  students look at holiday photos and talk about their likes and dislikes
			- A: roleplay travel agent/customer using travel brochure (T look for gaps and knowledge)
			- S: teacher covers gap above
			- A: used the fixed knowledge to create a travel brochure
			- E: what they like about radio/Tv
			- S: cover language grammar from advertise
			- A: students create their own TV advertise
