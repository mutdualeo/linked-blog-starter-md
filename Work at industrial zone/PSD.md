	cumulative from beginning to end 
	packout (product and pack) input output, shipment (send number, including FD [forwarder] and DS [direct ship to retailer])
	input (=packout, input must be equal to packout): find ke hoach sx (Thu)
	Shipment: ke hoach xuat hang (B825: Nguyet Anh - Alina; A247 Nga - Linzy)
	BOH: by on hand (in inventory)
		newest BOH: yesterday PK - today shipment
			Never a negative number (error)
	MP BOQ (multipack by on hand quarter)
			cut off each quarter (cut off CQ should be PK - shipment in that CQ)
	CW( current week)
